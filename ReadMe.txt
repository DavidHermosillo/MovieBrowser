The app by default displays the mock data when opened.

The search button must be pressed to submit the search for the movie entered into the search bar.

When a search is performed, if more than 10 results are returned, then there will be a button at the 
bottom of the displayed movies list to display the next 10 movies until you reach the bottom of the results list.

If you do display the 10 next movies then at the top of the displayed movies list will be a button to view the previous 
10 movies you were looking at until you reach the top of the results list again.

Pressing on a movie's "card" will display more information about the movie in a different page which includes the majority
of the info returned by the search because I followed the metadata idea that was thrown out during class.

One thing that I could not figure out was how to make the space between the "cards" touchable. At
the moment, you cannot scroll when you initially place your finger there. You have to touch the "cards"
in order to scroll. I think it may just be how flatlist works. 

Nothing to my knowledge will break the app.
